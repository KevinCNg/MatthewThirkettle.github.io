I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Cornell University.  My primary research interests include Econometrics, Networks, and Industrial Organization.   I have a particular interest in econometric methods for networks.  I am currently on the job market and I expect to graduate in Spring 2020.  

My website is located at <https://matthewthirkettle.com>, which contains my CV and research materials.

My job market paper can be downloaded [here](https://matthewthirkettle.github.io/files/Thirkettle_Job_Market_Paper.pdf).
